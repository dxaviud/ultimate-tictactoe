## Execution
Make sure that [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html) is installed. Clone this repository. In a terminal, navigate to the parent directory of src and run `javac src/TicTacToeStarter.java` to compile the java files into bytecode (.class files), then `java src/TicTacToeStarter` to execute the program.
